# Cooking.Conquest

## Description 
Learning to cook can be a daunting task, and to new cooks, vegetarian cuisine poses a unique challenge.  The goal of Cooking Conquest is to create an interactive way to introduce vegetarian recipes to aspiring cooks through a fun high fantasy RPG game environment.

While using the app, users select level appropriate recipes, and as they complete them, gain experience points to level up in game. As they progress through the levels, users will unlock new recipes and cooking skills that increase in difficulty. 

After level three, users have the ability to join a guild and post their own vegetarian creations. The guild feature provides an opportunity to interact, share, and compete with each other in the app community by reviewing and rating eachother's recipes. The app will also feature a leaderboard that showcases the top guildâ€™s ranking and top ranking individual cooks based on review scores, providing a sense of friendly competition and camaraderie within the app community.
