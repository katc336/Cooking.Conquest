                    Once you join a guild, you can compete with others by reviewing and rating each other's recipes, earning points,
                    and contributing to your guildâ€™s cumulative score.
                    This friendly competition and sense of camaraderie within the community will keep you motivated
                    and engaged in your vegetarian cooking conquest.
